CRITICAL (Wont' work at all til this is done):

FUNCTIONAL (wont' work well until you do it):
- Create a command to retrieve kindle email, so the user can know if they have to update it.
- Review workflow to assure some commands (like /set_kindle_email) can be invoken in the middle of the processing of another command (like /search)
- Put this projecct in a server.
- Create a docker image for this project and set the CI/CD from its github repo.
- Figure out the best way to access remote storage for the Library, so the server will only take care of the bot, not the library storage.


OPTIMAL (would be cool):
- If the book is found, take a screenshot and send it to the user to confirm it's the book they're looking for.
- Make it able to receive the link to the book instead of the name-author
- That the user can send an ebook file instead of searching it, so the bot send it to their kindle.

DREAMS (I'm not really doing it):
- Add more sources to get ebooks, if it doesn't find it by scrapping, a torrent client may be a good idea, even as a first search.
- Add an option to donate ebooks that are not already in the Library, so we can create a community library.
