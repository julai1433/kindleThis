CRITICAL (Wont' work at all til this is done):

FUNCTIONAL (wont' work well until you do it):
- Put this projecct in a server.
- Create a docker image for this project and set the CI/CD from its github repo.
- Figure out the best way to access remote storage for the Library, so the server will only take care of the bot, not the library storage.

OPTIMAL (would be cool):
- If the book is found, take a screenshot and send it to the user to confirm it's the book they're looking for.
- Make it able to receive the link to the book instead of the name-author

DREAMS (I'm not really doing it):
- Add more sources to get ebooks
