CRITICAL (Wont' work at all til this is done):

FUNCTIONAL (wont' work well until you do it):

OPTIMAL (would be cool):
- Test headless mode
- If the book is found, take a screenshot and send it to the user to confirm it's the book they're looking for.
- Make it able to receive the link to the book instead of the name-author
- Save a data base with the user id's and their email accounts, so the bot don't have to ask for it every time you use it.

DREAMS (I'm not really doing it):
- Add more sources to get ebooks
